As mentioned previously only a subset of Spring is implementated, but enough to build real applications. The question you have to ask yourself coming from Spring is how much Spring do you need?

The following notable features are currently not supported in Micronaut for Spring either and in general if a feature is not documented here consider it unsupported:

* *AspectJ* - Spring's AOP implementation is not supported, you can however use https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#aop[Micronaut AOP] which is compilation time and reflection free.
* *Spring Expression Language (SpEL)* - SpEL expressions are not supported, property placeholders are, however.
* *The Servlet API* - Any reference to the Servlet API is not supported
